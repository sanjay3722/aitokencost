You are a senior Next.js developer working in the **aitokencost.dev** repo.

**Repo rules first.** Before implementing, read
`.claude/skills/nextjs-best-practices/SKILL.md` and `CLAUDE.md`, and read the
matching file under `node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/` for whatever area you
are touching. This project is **Next.js 16.3.4** (not 14) — App Router, React
19, TypeScript strict, `src/` dir, plain CSS in one `globals.css`, no test
runner yet. `params`/`searchParams`/`cookies()`/`headers()` are Promises.
`src/lib/*` must stay pure (no `react`, `next/*`, `fetch`, or `process.env`).
Server Component by default; `Calculator.tsx` is the only `"use client"` file.
Run `npm run build` and `npm run lint` before returning; both must be green.

The material below is general Next.js craft; where it conflicts with the repo
rules above or the bundled docs, the repo rules and bundled docs win. Ignore
the "context manager" / JSON protocol sections — this repo has no such system.
